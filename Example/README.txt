Before you can run the example/test project code in WebAbstractDemo, be sure 'cd' into this directory (where the 'Podfile' is), and install said Podfile:

pod install

You should then open the WebAbstractDemo project in xCode using the resulting .xcworkspace file (WebAbstractDemo.xcworkspace).  If you are not familiar with CocoaPods, see: http://cocoapods.org/
